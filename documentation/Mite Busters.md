# The German Mite Busters
## Theme Song

Mite Busters!

If there's something strange sittin' on your bee,

Who you gonna call? Mite Busters!

If there's something weird and it don't look good,

Who you gonna call? Mite Busters!

I ain't afraid of no mite.

I ain't afraid of no mite.

If you're seeing things tiny and red,

Who you gonna call? Mite Busters!

An very small mite sitting on your bee,

Who you gonna call? Mite Busters!

I ain't afraid of no mite.

I ain't afraid of no mite.

Who you gonna call? Mite Busters!
